The system loads in 10000 books from the database goodbook?
As well as 100000 ratings

The user is defaulted to user #1 who has already made a few ratings

The user can then go on to make some more ratings from randomly selected books (although none that have already been read)

The books are added to the database and the matrix is redrawn and refactorised to allow for new recommendations based on the recent ratings

run by making sure that flask is installed (as well as all other important imports!)
- numpy, random, that weird linear algebra one, etc

then run in a linux machine by just going "python3 bookrecc.py" and it should work on the port number specified in the terminal
give it a few seconds on startup and for the first calculation
otherwise should be good
